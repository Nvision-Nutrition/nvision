Our team implemented an agile process as well as a modern Git workflow over the course of this project. We established the roles for our team early on in order to facilitate efficient team dynamics. We utilized a main deployment branch, testing branch, and seperate feature branches. Each team member made pull requests to the testing branch and our code reviews consisted of approval from one person within a feature team and an outside team member.
