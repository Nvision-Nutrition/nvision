## About

NVision Nutrition is a web and mobile-friendly nutrition tracking application that aims to encourage users on their weight loss journey. This app provides an easily accessible user interface to facilitate the key concept that fueling your body is a crucial element to living a healthy lifestyle.

A user will first sign up for an account where they are able to enter their calorie, macro, and water goals. Upon log in the user is able to submit entries and then will be updated on their progress and recieve motivation based on their daily activity. Our hope is to  support people in achieving their weight loss goals in a fun, motivational way.
